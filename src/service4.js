        materials. They are commonly used to assess the strain and stress on various structural components,
        helping ensure that they remain within safe operating limits.
      </p>

      <h2>Load Cells</h2>
      <p>
        Load cells are sensors designed to measure the force or load applied to a structure or component.
        They are used to monitor loads in retaining support systems and other structural elements.
      </p>

      <h2>Pressure Gauges</h2>
      <p>
        Pressure gauges are instruments used to measure fluid or gas pressure in various applications. In
        geostructural instrumentation, they are applied to monitor pressures in systems such as retaining
        walls and foundations.
      </p>

      <h2>Settlement Marker</h2>
      <p>
        Settlement markers are used to monitor and measure the settlement or subsidence of reclaimed land,
        often caused by tunnel boring or other construction activities. These markers provide insights into
        land stability.
      </p>

      <h2>Extensometer</h2>
      <p>
        Extensometers are devices used to measure the deformation and strain in materials. They are commonly
        employed in geostructural instrumentation to assess structural stability and the impact of loads.
      </p>

      <h2>Inclinometer</h2>
      <p>
        Inclinometers are instruments used to measure the angle of tilt or slope in various structures and
        geological formations. They help in assessing the verticality of boreholes, pile foundations, and
        retaining systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Piezometer</h2>
      <p>
        Piezometers are instruments used to measure the pressure of groundwater or pore water in soil.
        They provide essential data for estimating groundwater levels and direction of groundwater flow.
