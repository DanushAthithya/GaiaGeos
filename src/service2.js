      <h1>Geotechnical Laboratory Tests on Soil Samples</h1>

      <h2>Classification Tests</h2>
      <p>
        Soil classification tests are fundamental for understanding the properties and
        behavior of soil samples. These tests help categorize soils into various groups based
        on their composition and characteristics. They include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unit Weight and Moisture Content: Determining the weight and moisture content of
          soil samples to assess their density and water content.</li>
        <li>Grain Size Distribution - Sieve Analysis and Hydrometer Analysis: Analyzing the
          distribution of particle sizes within the soil sample, including coarse and fine
          fractions.</li>
        <li>Specific Gravity: Measuring the specific gravity of soil to understand its
          buoyancy in water.</li>
        <li>Index Properties – Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit, Plasticity Index, Shrinkage Limit:
          Assessing the soil's plasticity and behavior under different moisture conditions.</li>
        <li>Free Swell Index: Evaluating how much a soil sample swells when exposed to water.</li>
        <li>Chemical tests on soil and water: Conducting chemical tests to determine the
          presence of specific elements or compounds that may affect soil properties.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Engineering Properties Tests</h2>
      <p>
        Engineering properties tests delve deeper into the mechanical behavior of soil samples.
        They help in assessing the soil's suitability for construction and engineering projects.
        These tests include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strength Tests – Unconfined Compressive Strength, Direct Shear, Triaxial (UU, CU, CD):
          Evaluating the soil's strength and shear resistance under different conditions.</li>
        <li>Consolidation – 1D and 3D: Assessing how soil compacts and consolidates under
          applied loads, which is essential for foundation design.</li>
        <li>Permeability: Measuring the soil's ability to transmit fluids, which is crucial
          for drainage and groundwater flow analysis.</li>
        <li>Proctor Compaction: Determining the optimal soil compaction characteristics for
          construction and road building.</li>
        <li>California Bearing Ratio (CBR): Evaluating the bearing capacity of the soil
          subgrade for pavement design and road construction.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Geotechnical Laboratory Tests on Rock Samples</h1>

      <h2>Classification Tests</h2>
      <p>
        Rock classification tests provide insights into the properties of rock samples, helping
        categorize them based on their characteristics. These tests include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Water Absorption: Measuring the rock's ability to absorb water, which can impact its
          durability and strength.</li>
        <li>Density and Porosity: Determining the density and porosity of rock samples, which
          are vital for understanding their strength and behavior.</li>
        <li>Specific Gravity: Measuring the specific gravity of rocks to assess their buoyancy.</li>
        <li>Rock Cutting, Polishing, and Grinding: Preparing rock samples for further testing by
          shaping and polishing them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Engineering Properties Tests</h2>
      <p>
        Engineering properties tests on rock samples provide critical data for various
        engineering applications. They include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Point Load Index: Assessing the rock's strength and durability under point load
          conditions, which is valuable for rock mechanics studies.</li>
        <li>Unconfined Compression with and without Modulus: Measuring the rock's compressive
          strength under different conditions, including with and without modulus.</li>
        <li>P and S wave velocity: Determining the velocity of primary (P) and secondary (S)
          seismic waves in rock samples to understand their seismic behavior.</li>
        <li>Tensile Strength: Evaluating the ability of rocks to resist tension, which is
          important for construction projects and natural rock formations.</li>
        <li>Poisson’s Ratio: Measuring Poisson's ratio, which relates to the rock's elasticity
          and deformation characteristics.</li>
        <li>High Pressure Triaxial Tests: Subjecting rock samples to high-pressure conditions to
          simulate deep geological environments and assess their behavior under such conditions.</li>
      </ul>
